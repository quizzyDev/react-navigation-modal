# React Navigation Modal

### About this repo

This repo is a boiler plate expo typscript app that makes use of [`react-navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org/) and [`react-native-reanimated`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/) to handle `Modal` windows.

The project has been configured to use aliases for easy importing using the [`babel-plugin-module-resolver`](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver) and has an opinionated file structure for separating components, screens and utils etc.
